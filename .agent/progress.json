    "Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS configuration, and install all core dependencies listed in the coding guidelines (lucide-react, next-themes, framer-motion, react-hook-form, zod, clsx, tailwind-merge). Create the basic folder structure (`app`, `components`, `lib`, `content`) and configuration files.",
    "Implement the Design System and Atomic UI Components.\n1. Update `tailwind.config.ts` to define the custom color palette (primary, secondary, background, foreground) and ensure `darkMode: 'class'` is configured to work with `next-themes`.\n2. Create `components/ui/Button.tsx` with support for variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost) and proper sizing.\n3. Create `components/ui/Input.tsx` for form fields with accessible attributes.\n4. Create `components/ui/Container.tsx` to handle responsive max-widths and padding.\n5. Create `components/ui/Logo.tsx` featuring a simple icon and text mark.",
    "Implement the Core Layout components and integrate them into the root application structure.\n1. Create `components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx` using `next-themes` hooks to allow users to switch between light and dark modes.\n2. Create `components/layout/Header.tsx` incorporating the existing `Logo` and the new `ThemeToggle`, including a responsive navigation menu (mobile hamburger).\n3. Create `components/layout/Footer.tsx` with standard copyright and navigation links.\n4. Update `app/layout.tsx` to wrap the application in the `ThemeProvider` and render the `Header` and `Footer` around the `children` content.",
    "Implement the Hero Section (`components/sections/Hero.tsx`), update `app/page.tsx` to render it, and ensure `content/site-data.json` contains the necessary data structure (headline, subcopy, CTAs) to drive the component.",
    "[FAILED] Implement the Features section. Create `components/ui/FeatureCard.tsx` to handle individual feature display, `components/sections/Features.tsx` to layout the grid, and update `content/site-data.json` with the `features` array data. Integrate this section into `app/page.tsx`.",
    "Implement the Features section correctly. This involves creating `lib/utils.ts` to export the `cn` utility, fixing the duplicate keys in `content/site-data.json`, creating `components/ui/FeatureCard.tsx`, and building `components/sections/Features.tsx` to render the grid of cards using the fixed data.",
    "Implement the Social Proof section.\n1. Update `content/site-data.json` to include `testimonials` and `trustedBy` arrays.\n2. Create `components/ui/TestimonialCard.tsx` to handle the display of a single testimonial (avatar, name, role, content).\n3. Create `components/sections/SocialProof.tsx` to render the \"Trusted by\" logo strip and the grid of `TestimonialCard` components.\n4. Update `app/page.tsx` to import and render the new `SocialProof` section below the `Features` section.",
    "[FAILED] Implement the Pricing Section. This involves updating `content/site-data.json` with pricing data, creating `components/ui/PricingCard.tsx`, creating `components/sections/Pricing.tsx`, and importing it into `app/page.tsx`.",
    "Implement the Pricing section (`components/sections/Pricing.tsx` and `components/ui/PricingCard.tsx`), correct the syntax and structure of `content/site-data.json`, and integrate the section into `app/page.tsx`."
